						Understanding IP Addressing - IPv4
						----------------------------------
IP Address:
• IP Address is a Logical Address
• It is a Network Layer address(Layer3)

• Two Versions of IP:
 -IP version4 is a 32bitaddress  
 -IP version6 is a 128bitaddress  

IPversion4:

• Bit is represent by O or 1(i.e.Binary)
• IP address in binary form (32 bits): 01010101000001011011111100000001 /  00-50-56-C0-00-01(MAC/Physical)
• 32bits are divided into 4 Octets:

First Octet    Second Octet    Third Octet   Forth Octet
01010101       00000101          10111111     00000001

• IPaddress in decimal form:
85.5.191.1

Total IP Address Range 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255

IP Address Classification

IP address are divided into 5 Classes:
-------------------------------------
• CLASS	A	
• CLASS	B	Used in LAN & WAN
• CLASS	C	
• CLASS	D}	Reserved for Multicasting
• CLASS	E}	Reserved for Research & Development

Priority Bit:
• Priority Bit is used for IP Address classification.
• Most significant bit(s)from the first octet are selected for Priority Bit(s).

 - ClassA priority bit  is	O
 - ClassB priority bits are	10
 - ClassC priority bits are	110
 - ClassD priority bits are	1110
 - ClassE priority bits are	1111

Ranges:
-------	 
Class-A Range

O.O.O.O to 126.255.255.255 (Class A Total Range)

10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (Private Range) - non-routable IP on the internet

Default address or LoopBack Addresss : 127.0.0.0  --> 127.255.255.255
 
Class-B Range (Class-B Total Range)

128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 (Class A Total Range)

172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (Private Range) - non-routable IP on the internet

Class-C Range (Total Range)

192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 (Class A Total Range)

192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (Private Range) - non-routable IP on the internet
 
Class-D Range
224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
 
Class-E Range
240.0.0.0 to 255.255. 255.255


Octet Format:
------------
• IP address is divided into Network Portion & Host Portion

 - CLASS A is written as N.H.H.H

 - CLASS B is written as N.N.H.H

 - CLASS C is written as N.N.N.H

Network & Broadcast Address:
----------------------------
• Network address : IP address with all bits as ZERO in the hostportion.
• Broadcast address:IP address with all bits as ONES in the hostportion.
• Valid IP Addresses are between the Network Address and the Broadcast Address.
• Only Valid IP Addresses are assigned to hosts/clients.

Example-Class-A
• ClassA:N.H.H.H
Network Address:0xxxxxxx.00000000.00000000.00000000 BroadcastAddress:Oxxxxxxx.11111111.11111111.11111111

Example-Class-B
• ClassB:N.N.H.H
Network Address:l0xxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.00000000.00000000 BroadcastAddress:l0xxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.11111111.11111111

Example-Class-C	
• ClassC:N.N.N.H
Network Address:llOxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.00000000 BroadcastAddress:ll0xxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.11111111

IP Address	NetworkAddress and Broadcast Address
----------	------------------------------------
120.1.1.1	120.0.0.0 and 120.255.255.255

172.16.1.1	172.16.0.0 and 172.16.255.255

10.100.1.10	10.0.0.0 and 10.255.255.255

192.168.1.10	192.168.1.0 and 192.168.1.255

150.10.1.1	150.10.0.0 and 150.10.255.255

Identifying Valid IP Address:
-----------------------------	

IPAddress		ValidAddress
----------		------------    
119.1.1.1		Yes
172.17.255.255		No
11.1.0.0		Yes
195.255.0.255		No
142.10.0.0		Yes

Subnet Mask:
• Subnet Mask differentiates the Network and Host portions of an IPaddress
• Represented with all l's in the network portion and with all O's in the host portion.

Subnet Mask-Examples:
---------------------	
• Class A : N.H.H.H 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000
Default SubnetMask for ClassA is 255.0.0.0

• Class B:N.N.H.H
11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000
Default SubnetMask for ClassB is 255.255.0.0

• Class C:N.N.N.H
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
Default SubnetMask for ClassC is 255.255.255.0

Default subnet mask:
--------------------
IPAddress	Default subnetmask
---------	------------------
17.1.1.1	255.0.0.0
202.1.0.18	255.255.255.0
190.10.1.1	255.255.0.0
102.10.1.10	255.0.0.0
192.0.0.1	255.255.255.0

How Subnet Mask Works?

IP Address	:192.168.1.1
Subnet Mask	:255.255.255.0

Private IP Address:
-------------------
• There are certain addresses in each class of IP address that are reserved for Private Networks. 
These addressesare called private addresses.

• These addresses are not Routable(or)valid on the Internet.

Class A
10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
 
ClassB
172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255

ClassC
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255



Public IPAddress v/s Private IP Address:
