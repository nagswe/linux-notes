						 		Basics of Networking
						 		--------------------

Network:
• Interconnection of two or more devices is called as a network.
• The communication between two or more interconnected devices is called networking.
• Establishing connectivity between devices with the help of Hub/Switch/Access Point for Data Communication

Types of Networks:

• LAN-Local Area Network
• MAN-Metropolitan Area Network
• WAN-Wide Area Network

LAN:

• Local Area Networks are used to connect Interconnection of PCs and other Network devices that are very close together in a limited area such as a floor of a building, a building itself or with in a campus.

MAN:

• Metropolitan Area Network are used to connect networking devices that may span around the entire city.

WAN:

• Wide Area Networks which connects two or more LANs present at different geographical locations.

Internet:

• Internet is a massive network of networks,a networking infrastructure.
• It connects millions of computers together globally,forming a network in which any computer can communicate with any other computer as long as they are both connected to the Internet.

Network Topology:

• Bus Topology
• Ring Topology
• Mesh Topology
• Star Topology

Setting up a Network:

• Network Interface Card(NIC)
• Media (Cable/Wi-Fi)
• Network Devices (router/switch/firewall)


Network Interface Card (NIC):

• NIC is the interface between the computer and the network
• It is also known as the Lan card or Ethernet card

• Ethernet cards have a unique 48bit address calledas MAC(Media Access control) address
 - MAC address is also called as Physical address or hardware address
 - The 48bit MAC address is represented as 12Hexa-decimal digits
 - Example:34-97-F6-33-90-82

• Network cards are available in different speeds
 - Ethernet(10Mbps)
 - FastEthernet(100Mbps)
 - GigabitEthernet(1000Mbps)

Media:
• The purpose of the media is to transport bits from one machine to another.

Types of Twisted Paircables:

Category	DTR		Purpose		Connector
-------		-------		------------	---------
CATS		lO0Mbps		FastEthernet	RJ45

CATSe 		500Mbps				RJ45

CAT6		1000Mbps	GigabitEthernet	RJ45

Networking Devices:

• Switch
 - It is a hardware device that centralizes communications between wired devices connected with in a LAN

• Wireless Access Point
 - It is a hardware device that centralizes communications between wireless and wired devices with in a LAN

• Router
 - It is a device which enables communication between two or more different logical networks.

• Firewall
 - It is a device which protects the network from un-authorized access
 - It allows and denies the network traffic based upon policy configured.

LAN Cable types:

• Straight Through Cable
• Crossover Cable
• Rollover Cable

Straight Through Cable:
 • Generally used for connecting two devices of different types

Crossover Cable:
 • Generally used for connecting same type of devices.

Rollover Cable:
 • Generally used for connecting Router console port to Computer COMport.
